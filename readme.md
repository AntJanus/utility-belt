##Utility Belt

A JS Utility Belt meant to plug the holes in JS where no native functions have ventured.

For instance, did you know that PHP has around 80 array methods? While JS does have around 70 methods, most of them don't reach the level of complexity and utility that PHP does.

Also, did you know that while other programming languages have dedicated, algorithm driven functions while Javascript may not even have such functions?

It's time to change that and plug everything in.
